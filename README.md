# ABC Foodmart â€“ 5310 Group 3 Final Project

Welcome to the repository for **5310 Group 3's Final Group Project**.  
This project showcases our work in **database design**, **ETL processes**, and **analytical queries** for a fictional retail chain, **ABC Foodmart**.

## Project Overview
Our team has built a complete system that:
1. **Designs** a database with triggers and relationships.
2. **Simulates** realistic retail data and processes it via ETL.
3. **Executes** analytical queries to extract meaningful business insights.

The workflow follows a structured pipeline, starting from schema design and data preparation, all the way to advanced analysis.
